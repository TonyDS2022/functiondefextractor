Function Definition Extractor
====================
What is the project intended to do?
--------
Tool to extract the function definitions from the source code

It can be used to extract functions from,

- C  

- C++ 

- C#  

- Java  

- Python

- TypeScript

- JavaScript

Advantage of using such function extractions are,

- Resolving technical debt  

- Identify function similarity 
 
- Identify pattern check (Supress warnings, Asset, etc...)


Dependencies
--------
- python 3.8 : 64 bit  

- python packages (xlrd, xlsxwriter, pandas)  

- thirdparty packages [Ctags, grep]


Installation
====================
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) 

`pip install functiondefextractor`

Usage & Configuration
====================

Option 1: To call from script
--------

- General usage with out options. The below example script will return a 
  dataframe which contains the extracted functions from the given repo/code

```
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code")
print(out_put)
```

Option 2: commandline
--------

- General usage with out options

```
python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd -p path/to/repo
```

- Help option can be found at,  

```
python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd -h 
```

Note: 

1.To use annotation based search feature, input annot and delta parameters
 (For example annot = "@Test", delta = "5") which returns a data frame
 containing + and - delta number of lines from the given annotation

2.If annotation is known completely (Ex: @SuppressWarnings(unused)) user
 can extract methods with given annotation with annotation based search
 feature by inputting annotation alone (not necessary to specify delta).
 (For example annot = "@SuppressWarnings(unused)")

3.To use condition checker feature to analyse patterns present in the code,
 input the excel file generated by the extractor and pattern condition.
 
```
python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd -e path/to/excelfile, "Assert"
```
This will return an excel file and pivot table html files which contain
various assert patterns in the extracted code

Tool to extract the function definitions from the source code

It can be used to extract functions from,

- C  

- C++

- C#  

- Java  

- Python

- TypeScript

- JavaScript

Advantage of using such function extractions are,

- Resolving technical debt  

- Identify function similarity  

- Identify pattern check (Supress warnings, Asset, etc...)
  
## Dependencies

- python 3.8 : 64 bit  

- python packages (xlrd, xlsxwriter, pandas)  

- third party packages [Ctags, grep]

## Installation
  
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

```sh
pip install functiondefextractor
```

## Usage & Configuration

### Code

- General usage with out options.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code")
print(out_put)
```

- To extract functions based on annotation.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code", annot="@Test")
print(out_put)
```

- To extract delta lines(+/-) from code based on annotation/key word.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code", annot="@SupressWarning", delta="5")
print(out_put)
```

- To analyse various patterns in the code based on given condition.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.check_condition ("@SupressWarning", r"path_to_excelfile/dataframe", "(")
print(out_put)
```

### Commandline

- General usage with out options to extract functions from repo.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd --p path/to/repo
```

- To analyse various patterns in the code based on given condition.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd --c "@Assert" --e path/to/excel/dataframe --s "("
```

- Help option can be found at,  

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd -h
```

Note:

1.To use annotation based search feature, input annot and delta parameters
 (For example annot = "@Test", delta = "5") which returns a data frame
 containing + and - delta number of lines from the given annotation

2.If annotation is known completely (Ex: @SuppressWarnings(unused)) user
 can extract methods with given annotation with annotation based search
 feature by inputting annotation alone (not necessary to specify delta).
 (For example annot = "@SuppressWarnings(unused)")

3.To use condition checker feature to analyse patterns present in the code,
 input the excel file generated by the extractor and pattern condition.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor.extractor_cmd -e path/to/excelfile, "Assert"
```

This will return an excel file and pivot table html files which contain
 various assert patterns in the extracted code


### Output
  
- Output will be available in same folder as input file
